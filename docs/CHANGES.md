# Changes

## Current Release

### [v2.7.5](https://github.com/RGXMods/RGX-Framework/blob/main/docs/changelogs/2.7.5.md) - 2026-09-17

- Added WoW Forever Beta compatibility (Interface `16001` client) via runtime capability detection while retaining Retail `120100` manifest support.
- Uses the interface capability rather than client build `69893` to suppress restricted CLEU registration.
- Skips the generic SharedMedia global scan on Forever to avoid the measured startup hitch.

### [v2.7.4](https://github.com/RGXMods/RGX-Framework/blob/main/docs/changelogs/2.7.4.md) - 2026-08-23

- Standardized framework chat output as `{icon} - [RGX] {message}` through
  `RGX:CreateChatPrefix()`.
- Added a persistent global login-message gate with `/rgx login on|off|status`
  and the `IsLoginMessagesEnabled`, `SetLoginMessagesEnabled`, and
  `LoginMessage` APIs.
- Routed declarative `welcome` output through the login gate and reduced
  framework startup output to one gated, metadata-derived line.
- Added Lua 5.1 runtime coverage for persistence, command confirmations,
  declarative welcome behavior, prefix formatting, and startup deduplication.

## Recent Releases

### [v2.7.3](https://github.com/RGXMods/RGX-Framework/blob/main/docs/changelogs/2.7.3.md) - 2026-08-22

- Fixed `ADDON_ACTION_FORBIDDEN` from the v2.7.2 event-lifecycle flush: deferred
  native registrations now run only from an anonymous next-frame driver, never
  while unwinding an event dispatch, timer dispatch, combat, or pet battle.
- Registration success is verified with `IsEventRegistered`; unsupported or
  repeatedly rejected events are dropped after a bounded attempt cap instead of
  retrying forever. The 2.7.2 deferral guarantee is preserved one frame later.
- Retail no longer registers `COMBAT_LOG_EVENT_UNFILTERED`: new flavor-gated
  `combatLogEvent` capability, `RGXCombat` skips CLEU on Retail 12.x, and
  `RGXCombat:HasCombatLogEvents()` exposes the degraded surface.
- Event-lifecycle runtime coverage extended from 35 to 66 checks.
- Published assets are `RGX-Framework-v2.7.3.zip` and `release.json`; the addon
  archive contains 100 runtime files and all six flavor TOCs.

### [v2.7.2](https://github.com/RGXMods/RGX-Framework/blob/main/docs/changelogs/2.7.2.md) - 2026-08-22

- Fixed deferred WoW frame-event registrations created during framework event
  dispatch. Consumer events registered from `PLAYER_LOGIN`,
  `PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD`, or another handler now become native frame events
  immediately after the outermost safe dispatch returns.
- Extended the same lifecycle guarantee to registrations created inside RGX
  timer callbacks, closing the second path that could strand callbacks in
  `pendingFrameEvents`.
- Made unit-event unregistration clean up pending and native frame state
  symmetrically while preserving a shared registration when regular handlers
  still exist for the same event.
- Added 35 Lua 5.1 event-lifecycle checks covering login bootstrap, nested
  dispatch, unit events, timers, combat deferral, shared handlers, and
  removal-before-flush. Existing 166 timer and 86 restricted-aura checks remain
  green.
- Published assets are `RGX-Framework-v2.7.2.zip` and `release.json`; the addon
  archive contains 100 runtime files and all six flavor TOCs.

### [v2.7.0](https://github.com/RGXMods/RGX-Framework/blob/main/docs/changelogs/2.7.0.md) - 2026-08-15

- Added declarative named repeating timers with deterministic ordering,
  lifecycle binding, metadata, self-cancellation, and failure isolation.
- Hardened RGXAuras into an accessible-only restricted-value boundary and added
  the corresponding Lua 5.1 runtime and source-conformance coverage.

### [v2.6.2](https://github.com/RGXMods/RGX-Framework/blob/main/docs/changelogs/2.6.2.md) - 2026-08-14

- Synchronized distribution documentation and hardened release/package
  validation across the six supported WoW flavors.

### [v2.6.1](https://github.com/RGXMods/RGX-Framework/blob/main/docs/changelogs/2.6.1.md) - 2026-08-13

- Restored the single-product framework distribution boundary and aligned
  deterministic package verification.

### [v2.6.0](https://github.com/RGXMods/RGX-Framework/blob/main/docs/changelogs/2.6.0.md) - 2026-08-13

- Added capability-gated support and verified TOCs for Retail, Classic Era,
  TBC, Wrath/Titan, Cataclysm, and Mists Classic.

### [v2.5.1](https://github.com/RGXMods/RGX-Framework/blob/main/docs/changelogs/2.5.1.md) - 2026-08-12

- Added the cross-version compatibility layer, hardened aura payload access,
  and shipped accumulated UI and pet-battle fixes.
